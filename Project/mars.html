        <!-- https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/mars/overview/#:~:text=%E2%80%8BMars%20is%20the%20fourth,more%20active%20in%20the%20past. -->
        <p>While Earth is only the fifth largest planet in the solar system, it is the only world in our solar system with liquid water on the surface.<br>
            Just slightly larger than nearby Venus, Earth is the biggest of the four planets closest to the Sun, all of which are made of rock and metal.<br>
            Mars is one of the most explored bodies in our solar system, and it's the only planet where we've sent rovers to roam the alien landscape.<br>
            NASA currently has two rovers (Curiosity and Perseverance), one lander (InSight), and one helicopter (Ingenuity) exploring the surface of Mars.<br>
            Perseverance rover – the largest, most advanced rover NASA has sent to another world – touched down on Mars on Feb. 18, 2021, after a 203-day journey<br>
            traversing 293 million miles (472 million kilometers).The Ingenuity helicopter rode to Mars attached to the belly of Perseverance.<br>
            Perseverance is one of three spacecraft that arrived at Mars in 2021. The Hope orbiter from the United Arab Emirates arrived on Feb. 9, 2021.<br>
            China’s Tianwen-1 mission arrived on Feb. 10, 2021, and includes an orbiter,a lander, and a rover. Europe and India also have spacecraft studying Mars from orbit.<br>
            In May 2021, China became the second nation to ever land successfully on Mars when its Zhurong Mars rover touched down. An international fleet of eight orbiters is studying<br>
            the Red Planet from above including three NASA orbiters: 2001 Mars Odyssey, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, and MAVEN. These robotic explorers have found lots of evidence that Mars<br>
            was much wetter and warmer, with a thicker atmosphere, billions of years ago.

        <h1 class="WelcomePlanets">FUN FACT ABOUT MARS</h1>
        <p>Mars is named after the Roman god of war. Mars is also known as the Red Planet. This is because Mars is covered in soil, rock, and dust made from<br>
            iron oxide which gives the surface a red rusty colour. Mars is the 4th planet from the sun. It is 227,936,637 km (141 million miles) away from the sun.<br>
            It would take 300 days (around 8 months) to get there from Earth. Mars is smaller than Earth with a diameter of 4217 miles. This makes it the second smallest<br>
            planet in our solar system. A day on Mars lasts 24 hours and 37 minutes. One year on Mars is 687 days long. That’s 1.9 Earth years. This is because Mars is further<br>
            away from the sun so it takes longer to orbit it. The tilt on the axis of Mars is 25 degrees which means that the planet experiences seasons like we do on Earth as<br>
            different parts of the planet are closer to the sun at different times of its orbit. Mars has a thin atmosphere made from 95.9% carbon dioxide and 2.7% nitrogen. The<br>
            atmosphere is so thin that it’s not thick enough to trap the sun’s heat so it is very cold - ranging from -100℃ in winter to 20℃  in summer. Mars has very weak gravity.<br>
            Gravity on Mars is 37% less than on Earth. This means that on Mars you could jump 3x higher than on Earth. Mars is a terrestrial planet because it has a hard and rocky surface.<br>
            Its northern side is full of flat plains and the southern side has ridges and craters. Mars’ surface has many channels, plains, and canyons which could have been caused<br>
            by water erosion (water wearing away the surface). This could be evidence that open water in liquid form once existed on the surface billions of years ago. Mars experiences<br>
            violent dust storms powered by the sun which can last for months. The dust storms can completely cover the planet and continually change Mars’ surface. Mars is home to Olympus<br> 
            Mons, a dormant volcano and the largest volcano and highest mountain in our solar system. It is 16 miles high and 600 km across the base, making it 3x the height of Mount Everest.<br>
            The biggest crater on Mars is Borealis Basin. It is 5300 miles from end to end and covers 40% of planet’s surface.
