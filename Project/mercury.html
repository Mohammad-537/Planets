        	<h1 class="WelcomePlanets">OVERVIEW</h1>
        	<p>Mercury — the smallest planet in our solar system and closest to the Sun — is only slightly larger than Earth's Moon. Mercury is the fastest planet, zipping around the Sun every 88 Earth days.
        	</p>
        	<p>From the surface of Mercury, the Sun would appear more than three times as large as it does when viewed from Earth, and the sunlight would be as much as seven times brighter. Despite its proximity to the Sun, Mercury is not the hottest planet in our solar system – that title belongs to nearby Venus, thanks to its dense atmosphere.</p>
        	<p>Because of Mercury's elliptical – egg-shaped – orbit, and sluggish rotation, the Sun appears to rise briefly, set, and rise again from some parts of the planet's surface. The same thing happens in reverse at sunset.</p>

        	<h1 class="WelcomePlanets">INTERESTING FACTS ABOUT MERCURY</h1>
        	<p>Mercury's thin atmosphere, or exosphere, is composed mostly of oxygen (O2), sodium (Na), hydrogen (H2), helium (He), and potassium (K), so you can't breathe there.</p>
        	<p>Two NASA missions have explored Mercury: Mariner 10 was the first to fly by Mercury, and MESSENGER was the first to orbit. ESA's BepiColombo is on its way to Mercury.</p>
		<p>It is unlikely that life as we know it could survive on Mercury due to solar radiation, and extreme temperatures.</p>
