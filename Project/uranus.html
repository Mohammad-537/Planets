    <!--    TODO-->

        <!--        create a list with numbers-->

    <p>Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun.</p>
    <p>It has the third-largest planetary radius and fourth-largest planetary mass in the Solar System.</p>
    <p>Uranus is similar in composition to Neptune, and both have bulk chemical compositions which differ from that
        of the larger gas giants Jupiter and Saturn.
    </p>
    <p>For this reason, scientists often classify Uranus and Neptune as "ice giants" to distinguish them from the
        gas giants.
    </p>
    <p>Uranus's atmosphere is similar to Jupiter's and Saturn's in its primary composition of hydrogen and helium,
        but it contains more "ices" such as water, ammonia, and methane, along with traces of other hydrocarbons.
    </p>
    <p>It is the coldest planetary atmosphere in the Solar System, with a minimum temperature of 49 K (−224 °C;
        −371 °F).
    </p>
    <p>Uranus has a complex, layered cloud structure with water thought to make up the lowest clouds and methane
        the uppermost layer of clouds.
    </p>
    <p>The interior of Uranus is mainly composed of ices and rock.</p>
    <p>It has a solid core with a radius of about 1,800 km (1,100 mi), which is about 15 to 20 times the radius of
        Earth.
