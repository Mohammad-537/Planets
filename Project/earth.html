        <h1 class="WelcomePlanets">FACTS ABOUT EARTH</h1>
        <!-- https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/earth/overview/#:~:text=While%20Earth%20is%20only%20the,made%20of%20rock%20and%20metal. -->
        <p>While Earth is only the fifth largest planet in the solar system,<br> it is the only world in our solar system with liquid water on the surface.<br> Just slightly larger than nearby Venus, Earth is the biggest of the four planets closest to the Sun,<br> all of which are made of rock and metal.
            The length of Earth's day is increasing. When Earth was formed 4.6<br>
            billion years ago, its day would have been roughly six hours long.<br>
            By 620 million years ago, this had increased to 21.9 hours. Today,<br>
            the average day is 24 hours long, but is increasing by about 1.7 milliseconds every century.<br>
            The reason? The moon is slowing down Earth's rotation through the tides that it helps create.<br>
            Earth's spin causes the position of its tidal ocean bulges to be pulled slightly ahead of the moon-Earth axis,<br>
            which creates a twisting force that slows down Earth's rotation.<br> As a result, our day is getting longer â€” but not long enough to make a difference to your busy schedule.

        <h1 class="WelcomePlanets">FUN FACT ABOUT EARTH</h1>
        <!-- https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2469/10-interesting-things-about-earth/ -->
        <p>Earth has never been perfectly round. The planet bulges around the equator by an extra 0.3 percent<br>
            as a result of the fact that it rotates about its axis. Earth's diameter from North to South Pole is 12,714 kilometers (7,900 miles),<br>
            while through the equator it is 12,756 kilometers (7,926 miles).<br><br>
            The length of Earth's day is increasing. When Earth was formed 4.6 billion years ago,<br>
            its day would have been roughly six hours long. By 620 million years ago, this had increased to 21.9 hours.<br>
            Today, the average day is 24 hours long, but is increasing by about 1.7 milliseconds every century.<br><br>
            Earth's continents have had an on-again, off-again relationship that has lasted for millions of years.<br>
            Some 800 million years ago the great tectonic plates that Earth's land masses ride upon came together,<br>
            assembling the continents into a large supercontinent called Rodinia; what is now North America lay at the center of it.<br>
             Rodinia eventually broke apart into many pieces that re-collided 250-500 million years ago, creating the Appalachian Mountains in North America<br>
             and the Ural Mountains in Russia and Kazakhstan.</p>
