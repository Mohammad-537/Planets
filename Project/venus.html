    <h1 class="WelcomePlanets">OVERVIEW</h1>

    <p>
    <p>Venus is the second planet from the Sun.</p>
    <p>It is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty.</p>
    <p>Venus has been known since ancient times because it can be seen easily without a telescope.</p>
    <p>Venus has been visited by several spacecraft:<br> Mariner 2, Mariner 5, Mariner 10, Pioneer Venus 1, Pioneer
        Venus 2, and an orbiter called Magellan.</p>
    <p> Venus is the hottest planet in the Solar System<br> and it temperature is 737 K (464 °C; 867 °F).</p>
    <p> Venus is the second-brightest object in the sky after the Moon.</p>
    <p> Venus is the only planet that rotates clockwise.</p>

    <h1 class="WelcomePlanets">INTERESTING FACTS ABOUT VENUS</h1>


    <p>
        Venus is often called "Earth’s twin" because they’re similar in size and structure, but Venus has extreme
        surface
        heat and a dense, toxic atmosphere.<br>If the Sun were as tall as a typical front door, Earth and Venus would
        each
        be about the size of a nickel.</p>
    <p>Venus is the second-closest planet to the Sun,<br>orbiting at a distance of about 67 million miles (108 million
        kilometers)</p>
    <p>Venus rotates very slowly on its axis – one day on Venus lasts 243 Earth days.<br>The planet orbits the Sun
        faster
        than Earth, however, so one year on Venus takes only about 225 Earth days, making a Venusian day longer than its
        year!</p>
    <p>Venus has a solid surface covered in dome-like volcanoes, rifts, and mountains, with expansive volcanic plains
        and vast, ridged plateaus.</p>
    <p>The average surface of Venus is less than a billion years old,<br> and possibly as young as 150 million years old
        –
        which is relatively young from a geological perspective.<br>This is a major conundrum for scientists – they
        don’t
        know exactly what happened that made Venus completely resurface itself.</p>
    <p>Venus is permanently shrouded in thick, toxic clouds of sulfuric acid that start at an altitude of 28 to 43 miles
        (45 to 70 kilometers). The clouds smell like rotten eggs!</p>
    <p>Venus is an unlikely place for life as we know it,<br>but some scientists theorize microbes might exist high in
        the
        clouds where it’s cooler and the pressure is similar to Earth’s surface.<br>Phosphine, a possible indicator of
        microbial life, has been observed in the clouds.</p>
